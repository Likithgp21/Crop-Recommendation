**Crop Recommendation Using Machine Learning**

Project Overview:

The Crop Recommendation Using Machine Learning system utilizes various machine learning models to recommend the most suitable crops based on factors such as soil type, weather conditions, and historical crop data. By using these predictions, farmers can optimize crop selection, improving yield, reducing costs, and promoting sustainable farming practices.

Tools and Technologies
•	Backend:Python 
o	Flask: A lightweight web framework for building the backend of the application.

•	Frontend:
o	HTML, CSS, JS: Used to design and create the user interface for seamless interaction.

•	Machine Learning Models:
1.	LogisticRegression
2.	GaussianNB
3.	SVC (Support Vector Classifier)
4.	KNeighborsClassifier
5.	DecisionTreeClassifier
6.	ExtraTreeClassifier
7.	RandomForestClassifier
8.	BaggingClassifier
9.	GradientBoostingClassifier
10.	AdaBoostClassifier


These models are used to predict the most appropriate crop based on input features.

•	Serialization:
o	Pickle: Used to save the trained models for future use and faster predictions.
